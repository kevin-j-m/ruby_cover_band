# Installing The Presentation

In order to set up the Keynote presentation and have it display as expected, you
first need to install some fonts. Because this is a Keynote presentation, this
assumes a Mac.

## Install Fonts

From the `fonts/` directory, download and install one copy of the fragile and
wretched fonts. For most modern machines, I believe the tff versions are what
you want.

Extract the zip file, and install using the Font Book app. During the install
process, you may see some compatibility warnings for each font. That's expected.
Continue installing.

## Download Presentation

Download `beat_the_band.key`. Open with Keynote. Confirm that the first slide
looks like [this](https://speakerdeck.com/kevinmurphy/enough-coverage-to-beat-the-band)
to see the fonts are installed.
